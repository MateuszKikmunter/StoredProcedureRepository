Project with simple convention based repository for calling stored procedures and some extension methods to invoke stored procedures in a fluent way.
 
 Extensions are working with standard and user-defined table type parameters, repository works only with standard parameters, so both can be used interchangeably depending on individual needs.
 
 Project written because of a solution which I was working on which had very old database as source and I was able to get entities only with Linq to SQL or via stored procedures.
